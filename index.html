            <p class="card-text">Abstract:
In this paper, my co-author Sisty Basil and I explore the social impacts of energy-related detritus, what we call “energo-waste,” from failed or outmoded energy projects in rural Tanzania. The problem of electronic waste (e-waste) has captured public and scholarly attention, especially in sites like Agbogbloshie in Accra, Ghana with its dystopian vista of discarded <b>comput</b>ers, televisions and other electronic trash. Energo-waste creates similar yet different problems and takes m ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Ion channels, transporters, and redox-active membrane enzymes operate in dynamic environments shaped by fluctuating electrochemical gradients, which drive the movement of charged substrates across biological membranes. Despite great progress, uncovering the molecular mechanisms of transport—especially under nonequilibrium conditions—remains an outstanding challenge.

            <p class="card-text">We present a method, using the Bethe Ansatz, to produce exact dynamics for a collection of interacting particle systems. The Bethe Ansatz was introduced in 1931 by Hans Bethe to find eigenvectors and eigenvalues for the generator of a one-dimensional quantum spin system, which is also the setting for this talk. While the Bethe Ansatz proved to be an effective <b>comput</b>ational tool, providing deep insight into quantum spin chains, it lacked many rigorous theoretical guarantees for many years. ...</p>

Measuring the Health of the Brain: From Global Networks to Local Biomarkers
Abstract:
How do we measure the health of the brain? Unlike blood pressure or cholesterol, there is no single number that captures brain function. We are developing the Brain Entropy Index (BEI), a new measure that integrates thermodynamics, statistical modeling, and brain imaging to provide a global indicator of brain health. Using data from modalities such as EEG, fMRI, and MEG,  ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: We define new knot invariants, called colored Heegaard Floer homology for any knot K in the three sphere. This is the colimit of the cobordism maps from the (n, mn)-cable of K to (n, (m+1)n)-cable by letting m goes to infinity, which is invariant under full twists. We will describe the module structures of the colored Heegaard Floer homology and <b>comput</b>e the colored Heegaard Floer homology for L-space knots.</p>

One of these is the thresholding scheme by Merriman, Bence and Osher.
