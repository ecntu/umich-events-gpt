 Progress is both a necessary and a dangerous idea. It is necessary to motivate political action oriented to the future, and it is dangerous because the pursuit of progress has often given rise to episodes of paternalism, colonial domination and narratives of civilisational superiority. In this lecture, I try to defend a more critical account of progress. I start by distinguishing between moral and political progress, then explore the relation between political progr ...</p>
