*The Party's Interests Come First* is the first biography of Xi Zhongxun written in English. This biography is at once a sweeping story of the Chinese revolution and the first several decades of the People's Republic of China and a deeply personal story about making sense of one's own identity within a larger political context. Drawing on an array of new documents, interviews, diaries, and periodicals, Joseph Torigian vividly tells the life ...</p>

Although nearly 75% of global Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias (ADRD)cases will occur in low- and middle-income countries by 2050, little ADRD research includes data from these regions.

Middle Pleistocene (~780,000-~127,000 years BP) fossils that cannot be easily assigned to Homo erectus, H. neanderthalensis, or H. sapiens have traditionally been lumped into a generic category like “archaic H. sapiens” (or H. heidelbergensis). How to classify these fossils has been the subject of intense debate over the past several decades, a debate that is sometimes referred to simply as “The Muddle in the Middle."

I will discuss  light beams that have spatially inhomogeneous state of polarization, including their description on a so called higher-order Poincare sphere, an associated Pancharatnam-Berry phase, and their applications in optical communication and sensing. I will also discuss how exploiting Rayleigh, Raman, and Brillouin backscattering in optical fibers in combination ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: We present a unified offline decision-making framework. In the first part, we consider a class of assortment optimization problems in an offline data-driven setting. A firm does not know the underlying customer choice model but has access to an offline dataset consisting of the historically offered assortment set, customer choice, and revenue. The objective is to use the offline dataset to find an optimal assortment. Due to the combinatorial nature of assortment optimization, the probl ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">The squirmer model is used to model the swimming of microorganisms with hair-like structures known as cilia on their surface. The model uses a slip velocity defined on the swimmer surface to represent the collective motion of the cilia, resulting in a Dirichlet boundary value problem for the Stokes equations. We use the Helmholtz decomposition to define the slip velocity in terms of tangential basis functions on a surface of arbitrary shape. The reciprocal theorem (Green’s second identity for th ...</p>
