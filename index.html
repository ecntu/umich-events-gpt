To develop a mathematical formalism for decision-making, one usually studies functionals on the space of random variables, where the interpretation of the functional depends on the problem's context. For example, functionals can be used to calculate capital requirements in quantitative risk management or to calculate premiums for insurable losses in actuarial science. In prac ...</p>

We study dynamic finite-player and mean-field stochastic games within the framework of Markov perfect equilibria (MPE). Through the Kuramoto mean-field game, we investigate the emergence of multiple self-organizing equilibria with complex time-dependent dynamics. This is in contrast to continuous-time finite-player games, which admit unique MPE in the absence of monotonicity conditions. While discrete-time problems gener ...</p>
