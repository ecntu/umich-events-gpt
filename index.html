However, in many supply chains in LMICs, producers do not sell directly to the world market; instead, they sell through multiple layers of domestic intermediation. We study how these chains of intermediation affect incentives for quality production in the context of the Uganda coffee supply chain.

            <p class="card-text">In 2010, de Cataldo-Miglorini showed how to <b>comput</b>e the perverse filtration on the cohomology of an affine variety with values in a constructible sheaf using generic flags. In this talk, I shall introduce the Brylinski-Radon transformation, discuss its properties and derive consequences for the perverse filtration. Time permitting, we shall also discuss some arithmetic applications of our results. This is joint work with Ankit Rai.</p>

AI is becoming an integral part of our lives—helping with everything from drafting emails to diagnosing diseases. But behind the scenes, AI tools consume massive amounts of electricity. Training just one large AI model can use as much energy as thousands of U.S. homes do in a year. And as AI adoption grows, so does its appetite for power.

This surge in energy demand drives up operational costs, puts pressure on already-congested power infrastructure, and makes it harder to bring AI ...</p>
