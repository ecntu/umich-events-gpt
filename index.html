Our ability to build lasers of higher peak power into higher-intensity regimes of laser science is fundamentally limited by the optical damage thresholds of the dielectric coatings, glass, and metal that make up modern optics. Although we would like to have lasers capable of probing Schwinger-limit fields or accelerating large plasma volumes to relativistic speeds, current laser technology cannot be scaled much beyond the ten-petawatt level witho ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">A positroid is a matroid realized by a matrix such that all maximal minors are non-negative. Positroid polytopes are matroid polytopes of positroids. In particular, they are lattice polytopes. The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polytope counts the number of integer points in the dilation of that polytope. The Ehrhart series is the generating function of the Ehrhart polynomial, which is a rational function with the numerator called the h^*-polynomial. We <b>comput</b>e the h^*-polynomials of an  ...</p>

            <p class="card-text">Abstract: Scientific inference often involves inferring internal key parameters that determine the outcome of a complex physical phenomenon. The data themselves may come in the form of a labeled set that implicitly encodes the likelihood function; for example, in the form of (i) pairs of parameters and observable data according to a mechanistic (simulator) model, or as (ii) observed data and parameters 'measured' with high precision via an auxiliary experiment. We refer to inference in both intr ...</p>
