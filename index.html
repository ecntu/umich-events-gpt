In mathematical modeling, we often operate within axiomatic systems, (conservation laws, symmetries, and invariants), that are inevitably incomplete. The central challenge of automated discovery is abduction: can we reason backward from observed phenomena to identify the missing principles that our axioms fail to capture?

            <p class="card-text">This talk will be an introduction to the emerging area of discrete
homotopy theory, which applies intuitions and techniques from the
continuous setting to discrete objects such as graphs. It has found a
broad range of applications, both within and outside mathematics,
including to matroid theory, hyperplane arrangements, and data analysis.

I will discuss two of my own contributions to discrete homotopy theory,
one more theoretical and one more applied. The first is a proof, joint
with D ...</p>

Examples of common iterative <b>algo</b>rithms covered by the analysis include Gradient Descent (GD), proximal GD and their accelerated variants such as Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding (FISTA), as well as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SDG). For these estimators, we will i ...</p>
